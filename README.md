A Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at Integral University, passionate about data science, artificial intelligence, and emerging technologies. I continuously expand my technical expertise in C++, Java, Python, and explore machine learning, data analytics, and software development. 

My academic foundation at City Montessori School strengthened my analytical thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills.

I’ve had the privilege to represent India at the Indonesia International Mathematics Competition (IWYMIC), and receive a Letter of Appreciation from Defence Minister Rajnath Singh for outstanding achievements.

 I have also been recognized for communication and leadership — serving as a Prefect in the Student Council, and contributing as a core organizer of QUANTA, an international science and technology festival. These experiences have honed my abilities in collaboration, organization, and innovation.

I have mastered the art to leverage data-driven insights and emerging technologies to enhance decision-making and innovation in business and technology. My goal is to build a career as a data scientist, creating intelligent solutions that deliver measurable impact.

As I continue to grow academically and professionally, I am confident that these experiences will shape a meaningful and impactful future.
